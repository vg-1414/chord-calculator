* Chord calculator

This is a simple tool that returns note names for chords based on your
input.  It can optionally return frequencies for those notes, as well.

Simply running ~main.py~ will begin the program:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

  python3 main.py

#+END_SRC

You can loop as many times as you would like and you can also export
the chord tones/frequencies to a file for later reference.
